# Grid Display Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced AI Communication (src/main.rs)

**Added new AIRequest variants:**
- `GetGridStats { board_size: usize }` - Request MCTS grid statistics
- `GetDebugInfo` - Request debug information

**Added new AIResponse variants:**
- `GridStats { visits_grid, values_grid, wins_grid, root_value }` - Grid statistics response
- `DebugInfo(String)` - Debug information response

**Added new App fields:**
- `mcts_visits_grid: Option<Vec<Vec<i32>>>` - Visit counts per position
- `mcts_values_grid: Option<Vec<Vec<f64>>>` - Win rates per position  
- `mcts_wins_grid: Option<Vec<Vec<f64>>>` - Win totals per position
- `mcts_root_value: Option<f64>` - Root node evaluation
- `mcts_debug_info: Option<String>` - Debug information
- `ai_thinking_start_time: Option<Instant>` - Track AI thinking time
- `stats_request_counter: u32` - Throttle statistics requests

### 2. AI Worker Updates (src/main.rs)

**Enhanced AI worker to handle new requests:**
- `GetGridStats`: Calls `self.ai.get_grid_stats(board_size)` 
- `GetDebugInfo`: Calls `self.ai.get_debug_info()`

**Updated tick() method:**
- Handle new response types
- Track AI thinking start time
- Periodically request statistics (every 30 ticks)
- Only for Gomoku and Othello games

**Added helper method:**
- `get_ai_time_remaining()` - Calculate remaining time for AI move

### 3. Enhanced TUI Display (src/tui.rs)

**Completely rewrote draw_stats() function:**

**For Gomoku and Othello games, now displays:**

1. **Current player and AI state**
2. **AI thinking status with time remaining**
3. **Root value** - AI's evaluation of current position
4. **VISITS grid** - Shows visit counts for positions with significant exploration
5. **VALUES grid** - Shows win rates with color coding:
   - Green: > 0.6 (good moves)
   - Yellow: 0.4-0.6 (neutral moves)  
   - Red: < 0.4 (bad moves)
6. **TOP MOVES summary** - List of best 5 moves with:
   - Position coordinates
   - Visit count (V)
   - Win rate (R) 
   - Total wins (W)

**Smart display logic:**
- Only shows moves above threshold (10% of max visits)
- Limits board size to 15x15 for readability
- Compact format to fit in side panel
- Scrollable content with scrollbar

### 4. MCTS Integration (src/lib.rs)

**Fixed missing closing brace** in MCTS implementation

**The existing `get_grid_stats()` method:**
- Returns (visits_grid, values_grid, wins_grid, root_value)
- Uses `extract_move_coordinates()` to parse move positions
- Works with GomokuMove(r,c) and OthelloMove(r,c) formats

## Usage

The grid display automatically appears when playing Gomoku or Othello. The statistics update in real-time as the AI explores the move tree, showing:

- Which positions the AI is considering most seriously (high visit counts)
- How the AI evaluates each position (win rates with color coding)
- The AI's confidence in the current game state (root value)
- Time pressure when timeouts are enabled

This provides valuable insight into the AI's decision-making process and helps players understand why certain moves are preferred.

## Technical Notes

- Statistics requests are throttled to avoid overwhelming the AI worker thread
- Grid display is limited to boards â‰¤15x15 for UI clarity
- Color coding provides quick visual assessment of move quality
- Compatible with the existing responsive layout and scrolling system
- Maintains backward compatibility with other games (Connect4, Blokus)
