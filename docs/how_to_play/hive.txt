OBJECTIVE
─────────
Completely surround your opponent's Queen Bee with pieces (yours or theirs).

OVERVIEW
────────
Hive is a strategic two-player game played with hexagonal tiles.
There is no board - pieces are placed adjacent to each other on a flat surface.
Each piece type has unique movement abilities based on real insect behavior.

PIECES (each player has 11 pieces)
──────────────────────────────────
  Q - Queen Bee (×1)    Must be placed by turn 4. Moves 1 space.
  B - Beetle (×2)       Moves 1 space. Can climb on top of the hive!
  S - Spider (×2)       Moves exactly 3 spaces around the hive edge.
  G - Grasshopper (×3)  Jumps in a straight line over pieces.
  A - Ant (×3)          Moves any number of spaces around the hive.

PLACEMENT RULES
───────────────
• First piece: Place anywhere
• Second piece (opponent): Must touch the first piece
• All other pieces: Must touch ONLY your own color pieces

• You can only move pieces AFTER your Queen is placed

MOVEMENT RULES
──────────────
• The hive must always stay connected (One Hive Rule)
• Pieces cannot break the hive when moving

STRATEGY TIPS
─────────────
• Place your Queen early for flexibility, but not first!
• Beetles are great for pinning enemy pieces
• Ants can quickly surround an exposed Queen
• Keep your Queen mobile - don't let it get boxed in
• Control the center of the hive
• Grasshoppers are excellent for quick attacks
• Use Spiders to reach specific positions precisely
• Watch for "pillbugging" - moving pieces that would break the hive
