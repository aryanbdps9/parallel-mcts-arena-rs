STRATEGY TIPS
─────────────
• Play BIG pieces early - they're harder to fit later!
• Expand toward the center for more opportunities
• Block opponents by occupying key spaces
• Keep small pieces for tight endgame situations
• Create multiple "branches" from your corners
• Watch for diagonal paths - your lifeline for expansion
• Sometimes passing strategically can help
