OBJECTIVE
─────────
Have the majority of discs showing your color when the game ends.

GAMEPLAY
────────
• Two players: Black (⚫) goes first, White (⚪) second
• Place a disc to "capture" opponent's discs by flanking them
• Captured discs flip to your color
• You MUST capture at least one disc each turn
• If you cannot make a legal move, your turn is skipped

CAPTURING
─────────
• Place your disc so opponent's discs are between your new disc
  and another disc of your color (in a straight line)
• All flanked discs flip to your color
• You can capture in multiple directions with one move!
• Lines can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal

WINNING
───────
• Game ends when neither player can move (usually board is full)
• Count all discs - player with the most wins
• The board is 8×8 (64 squares total)

STRATEGY TIPS
─────────────
• CORNERS are the most valuable - they can never be flipped!
• Edges are stable once connected to corners
• Avoid giving your opponent corner access
• "X-squares" (diagonal to corners) are often dangerous to take early
• Fewer discs early can be better - more mobility!
• Try to limit opponent's legal moves (mobility strategy)
• The endgame is about disc count - early game is about position
