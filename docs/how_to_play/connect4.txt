╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

OBJECTIVE
─────────
Be the first player to connect {LINE_SIZE} of your discs in a row - 
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

GAMEPLAY
────────
• Players take turns dropping discs into columns
• Player 1 uses (Gray), Player 2 uses (White)
• Discs fall to the lowest available position in a column
• Current board: {BOARD_HEIGHT} rows × {BOARD_WIDTH} columns

WINNING
───────
• Form an unbroken line of {LINE_SIZE} discs in any direction
• The game ends immediately when a player achieves this
• If the board fills up with no winner, the game is a draw

CONTROLS
────────
  ← →          Select column
  Enter/Space  Drop your disc into the selected column

STRATEGY TIPS
─────────────
• Control the center column - it's the most valuable position
• Build threats in multiple directions simultaneously
• Force your opponent to block, creating opportunities elsewhere
• Watch for diagonal connections - they're often overlooked
• The bottom row is crucial - establish a strong foundation
• Try to get the "7th disc" in a column race (odd/even strategy)
• Set up "traps" where you can win in two different ways
