//! # Root Component - Application Shell
//!
//! This module implements the top-level RootComponent that serves as the application shell.
//! It's responsible for coordinating between different major UI modes and delegating
//! rendering and event handling to the appropriate child components.
//!
//! ## Design Philosophy
//! The RootComponent follows a simple delegation pattern where it determines which
//! child component should be active based on the current AppMode, then forwards
//! all rendering and event handling to that component.
//!
//! ## Component Hierarchy
//! ```text
//! RootComponent (this file)
//! ├── GameSelectionComponent (main menu)
//! ├── SettingsComponent (configuration screens)
//! ├── PlayerConfigComponent (player setup)
//! ├── InGameComponent (active gameplay)
//! └── GameOverComponent (end game results)
//! ```
//!
//! ## State Management
//! The RootComponent itself is stateless - it doesn't maintain any internal state
//! beyond its child components. All application state is managed in the central
//! App struct and passed down to child components as needed.
//!
//! ## Thread Safety
//! This component runs entirely on the main UI thread and doesn't need special
//! thread safety considerations. All AI computation happens in background threads
//! and communicates via message passing handled at the App level.

/// The root component that serves as the top-level container for the entire application
///
/// This component acts as the application shell, managing the overall UI hierarchy
/// and routing rendering/events to the appropriate child component based on the
/// current application mode.
///
/// ## Architecture
/// The RootComponent uses a simple delegation pattern:
/// 1. Examines the current AppMode to determine which child should be active
/// 2. Forwards all render() calls to the active child component
/// 3. Forwards all handle_event() calls to the active child component
/// 4. Manages the lifecycle of all child components
///
/// ## Memory Management
/// All child components are created once during initialization and persist
/// for the entire application lifetime. This avoids the overhead of creating
/// and destroying components during mode transitions while maintaining
/// component state across transitions.
///
/// ## Error Handling
/// The RootComponent propagates any errors from child components upward
/// to the application level, where they can be handled appropriately.

    game_selection: GameSelectionComponent,

    /// Settings and configuration component for all application parameters
