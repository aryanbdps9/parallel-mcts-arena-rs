//! # Blokus Game Implementation
//!
//! This module implements the Blokus board game, a strategic tile-laying game
//! where players place polyomino pieces on a 20x20 grid following specific placement rules.
//!
//! ## Game Overview
//! Blokus is a territorial strategy game for 2-4 players where each player tries to place
//! all 21 of their polyomino pieces on the board while blocking opponents from doing the same.
//! The player who places the most squares (fewest remaining pieces) wins.
//!
//! ## Rules and Mechanics
//! - **Initial Placement**: Each player's first piece must cover one of the four corner squares
//! - **Corner-to-Corner**: Subsequent pieces must touch corner-to-corner with existing pieces of the same color
//! - **No Edge Contact**: Pieces cannot touch edge-to-edge with the same player's pieces
//! - **Blocking**: Players can block opponents by placing pieces adjacent to their pieces
//! - **Passing**: Players must pass if they cannot place any pieces
//! - **Game End**: Game ends when all players pass consecutively
//!
//! ## Scoring
//! - Score is based on remaining piece squares (lower is better)
//! - Player with fewest remaining squares wins
//! - Bonus points for placing all pieces or ending with the single square piece
//!
//! ## Implementation Details
//! - 20x20 game board with integer player IDs (1-4)
//! - 21 unique polyomino pieces per player (monomino through pentominoes)
//! - All piece transformations (rotations + reflections) pre-computed for efficiency
//! - Move validation includes adjacency rules and corner-touching requirements
